This is a Python 3 wrapper for https://github.com/alanbarr/RaspberryPi-GPIO
and includes this repository as a submodule /src/C-Library.

This was written to satisfy my curiosity at extending Python with C.

#################### Building #################### 
TODO: Submodules

Change directory to src:
    cd src

Issue the following command (this may have to be done as root):
    python3 setup.py install

This will build the C library first then the Python module.
